[15] 	'King George V'.

[16]	I like how simple it is to define rules in prolog. It is really easy to do if you understand how it works?

[17] 	I didn't like how it was sometimes confusing as to which order the variables needed to be, but I eventually got used to it.

[18] 	I did enjoy the lab, except for the extra credit. One thing that made it difficult is not knowing if your answers generated were correct or not, but I am assuming they are.

[19] 	I spent about four hours on this lab. A lot of it was just copying the stack trace 62 liens at a time.

[20] 	Possibly, if I need to set up a database or some sort of easily searchably body of information.

[EC1] 	'David, Viscount Linley' ;
	'Sarah Armstrong-Jones' ;

[EC2]	'David, Viscount Linley' ;
	'Sarah Armstrong-Jones' ;

[EC3] The second one took longer because it had to look through every parent in the database twice instead of once.
	The stack trace will show that it is over twice as long.
